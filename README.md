## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models
- **Joblib**: For saving the trained model

---

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze the structure of the data.
   - Visualize distributions and relationships among features using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale numerical features.

4. **Feature Selection**:
   - Identify important features for the model.

5. **Model Building**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Model Deployment**:
   - Save the best-performing model using Joblib for future predictions.

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install Python (>=3.7).
   - Install required libraries using:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib
     ```

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook `Loan Approval Prediction.ipynb`.
   - Execute each cell step-by-step to understand and reproduce the workflow.

3. **Make Predictions**:
   - Load the saved model using Joblib:
     ```python
     from joblib import load
     model = load('best_model.joblib')
     prediction = model.predict(new_data)
     ```
   - Replace `new_data` with your input features in the required format.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following key features:

- ApplicantIncome
- CoapplicantIncome
- LoanAmount
- Loan_Amount_Term
- Credit_History
- Gender, Married, Education, Self_Employed, etc.

Target variable: **Loan_Status** (Approved or Not Approved).

---

## Model Performance
The best-performing model achieved the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: X%  
- **Precision**: X%  
- **Recall**: X%  
- **F1-Score**: X%  

(Replace `X%` with actual values after running the notebook.)

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the end-to-end pipeline of a machine learning solution for predicting loan approval. By following the steps outlined, you can use the trained model or modify the code to apply it to your specific datasets.
